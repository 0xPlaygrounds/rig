# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- *(streaming)* [**behavior**] mirrored from rig-core's provenance-typed part identity: `MultiTurnStreamItem` delta ids render minted stream identities namespaced (`rig:reasoning:0`) and unique within one stream only — they restart every turn of a run, so correlate across a run by `internal_call_id`, never by delta id; aggregated reasoning from minted-identity streams carries `id: None`, and id-less tool calls (gemini, ollama) carry the absent (empty) durable id

### Added

- *(agent)* add opaque, cloneable `ModelHandle` values with by-value `ProviderCapabilities` snapshots, plus default replacement, per-run default override (`using_model`), and hook-driven per-call selection via `AgentHook::on_model_select`
- *(agent)* add run-local extractor default-model overrides used across retries

### Changed

- *(agent)* [**breaking**] remove concrete model parameters from long-lived classic runtime types (`Agent`, `AgentBuilder` after `new()`, `AgentRunner`, prompt/stream requests, `Extractor`) — the typed model is erased once at construction; direct provider-model completion and streaming APIs remain typed
- *(agent)* completion-call hooks now resolve before model selection: the merged `RequestPatch` is exposed on `ModelSelection::request_patch`, request preparation runs against the selected model's captured capabilities, and `ModelSelection::previous_model` reflects issued attempts only

- *(completion)* [**breaking**] normalize completion responses at the provider boundary — `CompletionResponse` and `StreamingCompletionResponse` are concrete, carry normalized `finish_reason`/`provider`/`model`/`message_id`, and every provider model exposes typed `raw_completion`/`raw_stream` escape hatches
- *(completion)* add public `ProviderCapabilities`, replacing `CompletionModel::composes_native_output_with_tools`

### Removed

- *(completion)* [**breaking**] remove `CompletionModel::{Response, StreamingResponse, Client, make}`; model construction moves to the required `CompletionClient::completion_model`
- *(completion)* [**breaking**] remove the `GetTokenUsage` trait — read `StreamFinal::usage`
- *(completion)* [**breaking**] remove `CompletionResponse::raw_response` — use a provider model's `raw_completion`/`raw_stream`
