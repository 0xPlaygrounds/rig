## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- *(message)* [**breaking**] mirrors rig-core: message content is `Vec<T>`, and `OneOrMany` is no longer re-exported from the prelude
- *(agent)* [**behavior**] an empty assistant turn is no longer an error. The run loop rejected one as "model turn lost its assistant content", a guard that could not fire while providers fabricated an empty-text sentinel; it fired on exactly the legitimate cases once the sentinel was removed (an Anthropic turn ending empty after a tool result, a textless tool-call turn). Such turns are dropped from history by `is_empty_assistant_turn` rather than failing the run
- *(agent)* [**behavior**] every model call validates message content before the round trip, failing with the offending turn's role and index instead of a provider 400
- *(agent)* [**breaking**] the `ToolCallDelta` hook payload loses `tool_call_id` (provider ids arrive on the completed call; `internal_call_id` is the correlator); the streamed assembler keys delta state by `internal_call_id` and takes the assembled reasoning block's durable id only from the provider-issued `provider_id` — a rig correlator can no longer enter history. `MultiTurnStreamItem` delta ids are rig-generated correlators, stable per part and unique per run turn — correlate across a run by `internal_call_id`, never by delta id

- *(agent)* [**breaking**] tool-call identity follows rig-core's typed model: every call a hook or consumer observes carries a unique, non-empty `ToolCallId` (the provider's id when issued, minted otherwise, with provider absence recorded on `ToolCall::provider`). Hook contexts (`ToolCallEvent`/`ToolResultEvent`/`InvalidToolCallContext`) surface that durable id — never `Some("")` — and the invalid-call retry transcript correlates the invalid call and every validated peer by their own ids, so id-less wires no longer collapse peers onto shared feedback or replay empty `tool_call_id`s. `StreamedResolution::TurnAbandoned::skipped_tool_result` is boxed

### Added

- *(agent)* add opaque, cloneable `ModelHandle` values with by-value `ProviderCapabilities` snapshots, plus default replacement, per-run default override (`using_model`), and hook-driven per-call selection via `AgentHook::on_model_select`
- *(agent)* add run-local extractor default-model overrides used across retries

### Changed

- *(agent)* [**breaking**] remove concrete model parameters from long-lived classic runtime types (`Agent`, `AgentBuilder` after `new()`, `AgentRunner`, prompt/stream requests, `Extractor`) — the typed model is erased once at construction; direct provider-model completion and streaming APIs remain typed
- *(agent)* completion-call hooks now resolve before model selection: the merged `RequestPatch` is exposed on `ModelSelection::request_patch`, request preparation runs against the selected model's captured capabilities, and `ModelSelection::previous_model` reflects issued attempts only

- *(completion)* [**breaking**] normalize completion responses at the provider boundary — `CompletionResponse` and `StreamingCompletionResponse` are concrete, carry normalized `finish_reason`/`provider`/`model`/`message_id`, and every provider model exposes typed `raw_completion`/`raw_stream` escape hatches
- *(completion)* add public `ProviderCapabilities`, replacing `CompletionModel::composes_native_output_with_tools`

### Removed

- *(completion)* [**breaking**] remove `CompletionModel::{Response, StreamingResponse, Client, make}`; model construction moves to the required `CompletionClient::completion_model`
- *(completion)* [**breaking**] remove the `GetTokenUsage` trait — read `StreamFinal::usage`
- *(completion)* [**breaking**] remove `CompletionResponse::raw_response` — use a provider model's `raw_completion`/`raw_stream`
