# rig-agent

`rig-agent` contains Rig's classic agent runtime: builders, the serializable
sans-I/O run state, blocking and streaming drivers, typed hooks, contextual
tools, extraction, and runtime integrations.

Most applications should use the root `rig` facade, where this runtime remains
enabled by default. Low-level provider and backend contracts live in
`rig-core`; the experimental ECS-native sibling runtime lives in `rig-bevy`.
