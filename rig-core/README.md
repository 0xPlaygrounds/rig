## Features
- Agentic workflows that can handle multi-turn streaming and prompting
- Full [GenAI Semantic Convention](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) compatibility
- 20+ model providers, all under one singular unified interface
- 10+ vector store integrations, all under one singular unified interface
- Full support for LLM completion and embedding workflows
- Support for transcription, audio generation and image generation model capabilities
- Integrate LLMs in your app with minimal boilerplate
- Full WASM compatibility (core library only)

## Installation
```bash
cargo add rig-core
```

## Simple example:
```rust
use rig::{completion::Prompt, providers::openai};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create OpenAI client and model
    // This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env();

    let gpt4 = openai_client.model("gpt-4").build();

    // Prompt the model and print its response
    let response = gpt4
        .prompt("Who are you?")
        .await
        .expect("Failed to prompt GPT-4");

    println!("GPT-4: {response}");
}
```
Note using `#[tokio::main]` requires you enable tokio's `macros` and `rt-multi-thread` features
or just `full` to enable all features (`cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread`).
