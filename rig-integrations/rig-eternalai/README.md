## Rig-EternalAI
This companion crate integrates EternalAI and their blockchain capabilities with Rig.

**NOTE: This crate is currently not being actively maintained as of 3 Feb 2026. The provider company has pivoted entirely from providing completions, so this crate is non-functional until further notice.**

## Usage

Add the companion crate to your `Cargo.toml`, along with the rig-core crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
rig-eternalai = "0.1.0"
rig-core = "0.4.0"
```

You can also run `cargo add rig-eternalai rig-core` to add the most recent versions of the dependencies to your project.

See the [`/examples`](./examples) folder for usage examples.
